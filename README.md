#mcs-robotics

Repository for code for Student Robotics 2017. The game hasn’t even been announced yet! I don’t know what I’m doing!

Anyway, hopefully this will be useful. All code currently here assumes an arena similar to that at SR2016.

Additional libraries required for this code to run properly:

* pySerial
* pyudev
* v4l2

For the environment to be _exactly_ the same as in the actual robot, you'd need to have every library [here](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/python/libraries).
